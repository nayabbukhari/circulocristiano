<p>Automattic <a href="https://wordads.co/2015/12/28/adcontrol-plugin-is-here/" target="_blank">announced</a> today that its <a href="https://wordads.co/" target="_blank">WordAds</a> advertising network is now available to self-hosted WordPress sites via Jetpack and the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/radcontrol/" target="_blank">AdControl</a> plugin. WordAds, which bears a name confusingly similar to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://www.google.com/adwords/" target="_blank">AdWords</a>, delivers all the advertising seen on WordPress.com&#8217;s free sites. (Ad display on VIP or upgraded sites is opt-in.)</p>
<p>Self-hosted WordPress site owners who want to earn money with WordAds must first <a href="https://wordads.co/signup/" target="_blank">apply</a> to join the network and are required to meet a minimum traffic requirement. Automattic doesn&#8217;t publish the exact minimum necessary for eligibility but the <a href="https://wordads.co/faq/" target="_blank">WordAds FAQ</a> page says &#8220;a site generally needs thousands of page views each month.&#8221; The site will also need to have both Jetpack and the AdControl plugin installed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working on the plugin off and on (mostly off) since mid 2014,&#8221; said Derek Springer, a Code Wrangler at Automattic who helped write the AdControl plugin. &#8220;We took a big pause to completely re-work the back end (WordAds 2.0) which is what we are now using all over WordPress.com.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://wordads.co/2015/11/02/introducing-wordads-2-0/" target="_blank">WordAds 2.0</a>, unveiled in November 2015, integrated WordAds into WordPress.com‚Äôs main Settings interface with earnings reports and payout information. It also introduced a real time bidding environment where ad agencies and buyers can bid on global ad impressions.</p>
<p>In 2013, Automattic paid out around $1 million to WordAds publishers whose sites delivered 1 billion ad impressions per month. Published numbers are not yet available for 2015, but WordAds 2.0 has increased interest in the program, according to the <a href="https://wordads.co/2015/12/28/adcontrol-plugin-is-here/" target="_blank">announcement</a> today. With the release of AdControl for self-hosted sites, the number of publishers available on the network has the potential to increase significantly.</p>
<h3>Why Does AdControl Require Jetpack?</h3>
<p>For years, the WordPress community has been <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-important-is-jetpack-on-wordpress-road-to-50-market-share" target="_blank">waiting to see how Automattic will monetize Jetpack</a>. In addition to giving self-hosted users access to many of WordPress.com&#8217;s features, Jetpack now serves as a gateway to Automattic&#8217;s advertising network for more than 1 million active installs.</p>
<p>I asked Springer why AdControl requires Jetpack and he cited the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need the site‚Äôs unique ID (assigned to each Jetpack site) to track ad impressions in the back-end.</li>
<li>We piggyback on Jetpack‚Äôs REST API connection to access some authenticated endpoints in the WP.com API.</li>
<li>The payout/earning settings are all controlled via Calypso and we want a singular, unified experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>WordAds is deeply tied into WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure and as such requires authentication for tracking and rewarding participating sites. Jetpack provides the connecting link and is now key to opening up the world of independently-hosted WordPress blogs to Automattic&#8217;s advertising network.</p>

<p>Most of the themes created by the professional design team at WordPress.com are geared towards bloggers. Business themes make up a much smaller segment of those designed in-house. That&#8217;s why the latest <a href="https://wordpress.com/themes/pique" target="_blank">Pique</a> theme is an unusual and exciting release.</p>
<p>Although the theme was originally designed for coffee shops, it also works well for other small businesses like caf√©s, bakeries, hair salons, and shops. Pique can be instantly branded for any business by uploading a logo and a custom header.</p>
<p>Its unique scrolling front page is created by adding panel sections, which are actually standard pages with content and featured images. Pique includes eight optional panels, which can be assigned within the customizer. Each panel control includes a dropdown selection of pages for the panel content, a background color option, and the ability to adjust the featured image&#8217;s opacity.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pique-front-page.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50044"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pique-front-page.png?resize=1025%2C2032" alt="pique-front-page" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50044" /></a></p>
<p>Single posts have an optional sidebar and the footer also includes three widget areas. Pique supports different page designs via three unique templates: full-width, grid, and testimonials. A grid style page needs to be set as a parent page and individual items will show up if they are set as child pages. The featured image of the child page displays as an image in the grid. It&#8217;s a somewhat convoluted process that&#8217;s not terribly intuitive, but it works.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/grid-template.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50047"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/grid-template.png?resize=660%2C343" alt="grid-template" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50047" /></a></p>
<p>Testimonials and recent blog posts can be displayed within the panels following instructions in the theme&#8217;s documentation. All testimonial content can also be viewed via its dedicated archive page at /testimonial/.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/testimonial-template.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50049"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/testimonial-template.png?resize=660%2C264" alt="testimonial-template" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50049" /></a></p>
<p>Pique has the capacity for special formatting using icons from <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>. Call-to-action buttons and panel overlay text can be added using short HTML snippets from the theme&#8217;s instructions.</p>
<p>Pique makes it easy for anyone to build a one-page, branded website with all the specialized content sections that you would traditionally expect from a business theme. It has not yet arrived on WordPress.org but self-hosted uses can download the theme as a zip file from its <a href="https://wordpress.com/themes/pique" target="_blank">homepage on WordPress.com</a>.</p>

After installing <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-woocommerce-brands/">Ultimate WooCommerce Brands</a> developed by <a href="http://magniumthemes.com/">MagniumThemes</a>, a large admin notice appears with an affiliate linked display banner for Bluehost.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/BluehostBannerInsidePlugin.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50021"><img class="size-full wp-image-50021" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/BluehostBannerInsidePlugin.png?resize=815%2C363" alt="Bluehost Banner Admin Notice" /></a>Bluehost Banner Admin Notice
<p>Ultimate WooCommerce Brands is a freemium plugin and while I&#8217;m not against plugin authors making a few bucks through advertising, displaying a webhosting banner seems irrelevant.</p>
<p>The advertising banner also shows up on every admin page in the WordPress backend which I feel abuses the admin notice function, even though there&#8217;s a &#8220;Hide This Message button&#8221;. Upsells and advertising should be confined to the plugin&#8217;s activation and settings pages according to number 11 of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/">WordPress plugin directory guidelines</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plugins should not hijack the blog admin. It is fine to include an Upgrade prompt on the plugin admin page, but not throughout the blog. It is acceptable to embed a widget on the dashboard but this should be the same size as others and be dismissable. It&#8217;s fine to put an error message at the top of the admin for special cases, but it should be linked to a way to fix the error and it should be infrequent. Any form of &#8220;nagging&#8221; is absolutely prohibited.</p></blockquote>
<p>Samuel &#8216;Otto&#8217; Wood, a member of the group and plugin review team <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/1059920750736805/?comment_id=1062714040457476&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D">confirmed</a> that plugins that display advertising on every admin page violate the guidelines and users should report them by emailing <strong>plugins at wordpress.org. </strong></p>
<h2>The Guidelines Provide Wiggle Room</h2>
<p>The plugin review team polices content in plugins, prevents spam, and attempts at bad faith from entering the directory. They also advise authors when they feel something that the plugin does is a bad idea. It&#8217;s important to note that <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/">the guidelines</a> are not black and white. Instead, they&#8217;re somewhat subjective which allows the team to make decisions on a case by case basis.</p>
<h2>The Power of Reviews</h2>
<p>The WordPress plugin directory gives users an opportunity to provide feedback directly to plugin developers and users through reviews. Reviews are an excellent way to tell the developer why you dislike or like a plugin and it also gives fellow users in the community a heads up.</p>
<p>So far, no one has mentioned the display advertising in <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/ultimate-woocommerce-brands">their reviews</a> of Ultimate WooCommerce Brands. Perhaps it&#8217;s not an issue or users have chosen to disable it and move on to a different option. One of the benefits of WordPress is that there&#8217;s usually more than one plugin available to accomplish a task.</p>
<p>Jan Dembowksi, a volunteer moderator for the WordPress.org support forums, explains another benefits to reviewing plugins &#8220;Some of the forum moderators read <em>every</em> review. Occasionally, there may be a pattern if there‚Äôs a complaint such as not being able to dismiss the upsell banner or taking over the dashboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes that leads to the moderator installing the plugin or theme on a test installation. This is to see if there‚Äôs really a problem or not. If there‚Äôs a valid concern then it gets reported up. It doesn‚Äôt happen often thankfully, but it has occurred and the plugin or theme author got a polite shoulder tap,&#8221; Dembowski told the Tavern.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Your Breaking Point?</h2>
<p>We know that upsells and display advertising are allowed in plugins as long as they follow the directory guidelines. How a plugin&#8217;s settings pages are displayed is up to the developer, but, as a user, how much advertising or upselling is too much? What&#8217;s your advertising limit inside a freemium plugin before you purchase the pro version or move on to an alternative?</p>

The folks at 10up have open sourced <a href="https://github.com/10up/flexibility" target="_blank">Flexibility</a>, a polyfill that uses JavaScript to allow Flexbox to work with IE  versions 8 and 9.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/flexibility.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49998"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/flexibility.png?resize=1025%2C386" alt="flexibility" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49998" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, Flexbox support wasn‚Äôt added to Internet Explorer until version 10, leaving older versions ‚Äì still popular in some corners ‚Äì out of the Flexbox revolution,&#8221; said Taylor Lovett, 10up&#8217;s Director of Web Engineering. &#8220;This idea didn‚Äôt sit well with 10up‚Äôer Jonathan Neal, tasked with engineering a beautiful layout for a Fortune 50 forced to contend with supporting older versions. We decided to subsidize his time to see if we could introduce Flexbox support under less-than-ideal browser requirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>CSS Tricks has a comprehensive <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">guide to to Flexbox</a>, a layout it recommends as more appropriate for components of an application or smaller-scale sites, (as an alternative to the <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" target="_blank">Grid</a> for large-scale layouts).</p>
<p>The idea behind Flexbox, according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/" target="_blank">w3.org docs</a>, is to provide a flexible container that expands or shrinks based on available layout space:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can ‚Äúflex‚Äù their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Flexbox is ideal for creating layouts that work with various screen sizes and devices, especially in cases where the layout&#8217;s container size is unknown or dynamic. Flexibility extends this to IE 8 and 9 by tapping into the browser&#8217;s <code><a href="http://help.dottoro.com/ljqkvomc.php" target="_blank">currentStyle</a></code> and <code><a href="http://help.dottoro.com/ljhddfwr.php" target="_blank">runtimeStyle</a></code> proprietary features to manipulate and overwrite style declarations.</p>
<p>Once you include flexibility.js somewhere within your project, it will automatically detect Flexbox elements and write new styles to make them work with IE 8 and 9. Flexibility is licensed under the GPL v2 (or later).

<p>At a time where large websites such as <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/removing-blog-comments/">Copyblogger</a> and the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/2015/12/16/toronto-star-closing-commenting-on-thestarcom.html">Toronto Star</a> are closing down comments in favor of social media, the Tavern continues to be a source of open conversation about WordPress. However, 2015 has been a tough year as a moderator.</p>
<h2>A Year of Firsts</h2>
<p>For the first time in years, I created a <a href="http://wptavern.com/comment-policy">comment moderation policy</a> to establish a baseline of expectations for moderators and commenters. Also for the first time in the site&#8217;s history, I banned an individual from leaving comments on the Tavern.</p>
<p>In the Tavern&#8217;s early days, I looked forward to discussing things with people via the comments and did everything I could to encourage them. Some of the conversations over the years have been great and have led to positive changes in WordPress. Six years later, many of the comments on the Tavern appear to be filled with anger, mostly from the same people. Dealing with so much negativity all the time makes comment moderation difficult.</p>
<h2>Taking a More Active Role in Discussions</h2>
<p>One of my New Years resolutions for 2016 is to take a more active role in the discussions on the Tavern. I want to reestablish the feeling the Tavern had a few years ago where everyone is welcome to share their opinions as long as its done in a respectful way.</p>
<p>Comments are a great way to share feedback, ideas, opinions, and look at things from a different perspective. But when the conversation turns into a mud-slinging contest which has recently happened too often on the Tavern, it turns into a pile of meaningless words.</p>
<h2>Commenting Goals for 2016</h2>
<p>In 2016, let&#8217;s try to having meaningful conversations where words transition into action. Let&#8217;s discuss ideas, opinions, and perspectives without getting or taking things personal. Let&#8217;s encourage collaboration instead of infighting. Let&#8217;s assume the best in someone&#8217;s words instead of the worst. In the New Year, I&#8217;ll do my best to try to lead conversations in these directions but I need commenters to do their part as well.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who&#8217;s commented on the Tavern over the years. Your feedback is and continues to be a valuable asset to this site. Instead of leaving the lights on, we&#8217;ll leave the comment form open and we encourage everyone to continue sharing their thoughts and opinions with us.</p>

Kashif organizes the local Lahore meetup, which started with a few dozen attendees three months ago and grew to more than 500 this past weekend. His team has been working hard to bring WordCamp to Pakistan, and today their application was approved by the WordPress Foundation.</p>
<p>The event will officially be called WordCamp Lahore. Kashif said that they originally proposed &#8220;WordCamp Pakistan&#8221; but were asked to keep it local to the city. The Foundation&#8217;s reply to their request was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>We stay away from labeling WordCamps with the country name rather than the city, because we have found that doing so discourages local organizers from doing additional WordCamps in the country. We had some problems with this in the past, where because there was a &#8220;national&#8221; WordCamp, no other WordCamps ever happened in that country. When we changed the naming convention to be city-focused, that country developed stronger local communities and several WordCamps per year.</p></blockquote>
<p>The application proposed September for the event but the dates have not yet been finalized. WordCamp Lahore organizers will have an orientation meeting with WP Foundation representatives tomorrow to begin the planning process.</p>
<p>Kashif told the Tavern that they are looking at the <a href="http://www.expolahore.com/" target="_blank">Lahore International Expo Centre</a> as a possible venue, since it has an 820 seat capacity. The team will be meeting with a few different venue providers to find a good fit.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/expo-centre-lahore.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-49973"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/expo-centre-lahore.jpg?resize=600%2C360" alt="Lahore International Expo Centre" class="size-full wp-image-49973" /></a>Lahore International Expo Centre
<p>As Pakistan is a multilingual country, most of the Lahore meetup sessions are conducted in English. This means that the WordCamp will likely be accessible to a wide range of people outside of Pakistan as well. If the Lahore meetup attendance numbers are any indication, the first WordCamp in Pakistan has the potential to be one of the largest first WordCamps in history.</p>

<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailbag/" target="_blank">Mailbag</a> is not a new plugin but it&#8217;s one of those convenient tools you&#8217;ll want to bookmark if you build WordPress sites that require email subscription forms. The plugin makes it easy to add a MailChimp or Campaign Monitor email form to posts or pages using a shortcode.</p>
<p>I only recently came across it while <a href="http://wptavern.com/politics-a-free-wordpress-theme-for-political-campaigns" target="_blank">reviewing the Politics theme</a>, which prominently features an email signup form powered by Mailbag.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/politics-screenshot.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49589"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/politics-screenshot.png?resize=705%2C460" alt="politics-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49589" /></a></p>
<p>If you have your Mailchimp or Campaign Monitor API key handy, then you can add your email subscription form in under a minute. Paste in the key, select your list, and customize your button text. (Your API keys must be saved before you can select a list to add subscribers.) Once these settings are saved, you can place the shortcode anywhere within your content.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mailbag-settings.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49929"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mailbag-settings.png?resize=1025%2C889" alt="mailbag-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49929" /></a></p>
<p>The flexibility for styling the forms is what sets this plugin apart. You can opt to use the built-in minimal Mailbag styling or allow your theme to dictate the style. If you choose to disable the default style, the usage tab on the plugin&#8217;s settings page outlines the CSS classes you will want to customize.</p>
<pre class="brush: css; light: true; title: ; notranslate">
.mailbag-wrap { /* Wraps entire form */ }

.mailbag-wrap label { /* Label styles */ }

.mailbag-wrap input[type="text"] { /* Name and email input styles */ }

.mailbag-wrap input[type="submit"] { /* Submit button styles */ }
</pre>
<p>Mailbag was created by the folks at <a href="https://arraythemes.com/" target="_blank">Array</a> for use with <a href="https://arraythemes.com/themes/transmit-wordpress-theme/" target="_blank">Transmit</a>, a landing page theme that features an email subscription form. Array built it to be compatible with any theme (not just their own) and made the plugin freely available on WordPress.org</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/transmit-mailbag.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-49933"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/transmit-mailbag.jpg?resize=984%2C783" alt="transmit-mailbag" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49933" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a theme developer and your theme requires an email subscription form, there&#8217;s no need to reinvent the wheel or bloat your theme with extra functionality. It&#8217;s much easier to select professionally supported plugins from WordPress.org and present the user with plugin recommendations using a tool like <a href="http://tgmpluginactivation.com/" target="_blank">TGM Plugin Activation</a>. You can design around your recommended plugins without having to support and maintain them.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailbag/" target="_blank">Mailbag</a> is easy for users to configure, publicly distributed on WordPress.org, and doesn&#8217;t take a heavy hand to styling. If you want a solid, simple plugin to use and recommend, this is a handy one to tuck into your toolbag.</p>

<p>Contributors to the WordPress core <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/customize/" target="_blank">Customize component</a> are targeting the upcoming 4.5 release for inclusion of a new feature plugin. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-pane-resizer/" target="_blank">Customize Pane Resizer</a> allows users to drag the edge of the pane to make the customizer wider than the default 300px.</p>
<p>According to Customize component maintainer <a href="https://weston.ruter.net/" target="_blank">Weston Ruter</a>, the idea for the plugin came out of the community summit held earlier this month in Philadelphia, where it was raised as a usability improvement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Justin Sternberg took ownership of the idea and we collaborated on it over the course of the community summit and WCUS,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;He did all the real work, and I just contributed ideas and provided Customizer architectural pointers.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the moment, the pane simply resizes when the user drags the resize icon, but even this one feature involves refining many tiny details. Ruter said the immediate roadmap for the plugin is to resolve the <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-pane-resizer/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issues</a> that have already been logged.</p>
<h3>Future Possibility of Undocking the Customizer and Adding Inline Controls</h3>
<p>Contributors have many other ideas for extending this feature, including the possibility of introducing positioning options (ie. right/left/bottom). These ideas are in the discussion phase and are not set in stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to being able to move the pane to the right (or to the top/bottom, which are technically problematic), Justin had the idea of allowing the pane to be dragged anywhere on the screen,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this way the Customizer pane would work like panels in PhotoShop which can be docked into the sidebar or they can be dragged out to float freely. This would allow the Customizer to be positioned anywhere on the screen, with a full page preview in background.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside the idea of the customizer pane becoming a floating window, contributors are also <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32296" target="_blank">discussing</a> applying this same concept to individual customizer controls. This ties into one of the items on Ruter&#8217;s <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/23/outlining-a-possible-roadmap-for-the-customizer/" target="_blank">longer-term roadmap for the Customizer</a> &#8211; inline controls:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚Äã<strong>Bootstrapped Customizer</strong>:‚Äã Lazy-load the Customizer into the current frontend view without having to leave the page. With selective refresh implemented, inline controls and frontend bootstrapping would be possible since full-page refreshes would no longer be required.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Instead of all of the controls being docked into the one pane and organized into panels and sections, they could instead (or in addition) be displayed alongside the elements in the preview that they modify,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;For example, editing a widget could pop open a floating widget form control next to the widget in the preview.&#8221;</p>
<p>These alternative UI considerations are currently beyond the scope of the Customize Pane Resizer feature plugin, which Ruter said will be limited to polishing up the resizing feature for 4.5.</p>
<h3>The Customize Pane Resizer Addresses Important Usability Concerns</h3>
<p>When <a href="http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-officially-proposed-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-3" target="_blank">menus were added to the customizer in WordPress 4.3</a>, many thought that the narrow width of the pane created a cramped menu management experience. The ability to resize the customizer pane addresses this concern by allowing users to expand it for tasks that require more real estate.</p>
<p>Ruter doesn&#8217;t anticipate many objections to merging the Customize Pane Resizer plugin, given that it solves several usability problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it is very controversial,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It seems a major complaint I hear often about the Customizer is that it doesn&#8217;t give the user enough room, so this would allow the user to have as much room as they want.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another concern I&#8217;ve heard is that people don&#8217;t know the pane can be collapsed at all (even though there is a collapse button on the bottom), so this greatly improves the visibility of collapsing and it implements a common UI paradigm where panes can be resized by dragging on their edge (e.g. Chrome dev tools),&#8221; Ruter said.</p>
<p>In making the pane resizable, Ruter&#8217;s chief concern is ensuring that the controls will respond nicely to varying widths, including those created by plugins. Expanding the customizer pane with the resizer plugin currently stretches the controls somewhat awkwardly and in some cases leaves a lot of empty real estate.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/customize-pane-expanded.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49918"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/customize-pane-expanded.png?resize=1025%2C396" alt="customize-pane-expanded" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49918" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest concern I have is that controls are designed for the 300px width, generally,&#8221; Ruter said. &#8220;So if the width is all of a sudden 900px, then the (custom) controls may well not look right.</p>
<p>&#8220;The controls in Core need to be updated to ensure they work in a variable-width pane. But plugin controls would need to do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you want to help contribute to the Customizer Pane Resizer&#8217;s development, check out the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-pane-resizer" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>. It is <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customize-pane-resizer/" target="_blank">available on WordPress.org</a> but the GitHub version is always more up-to-date. If you have developed a plugin or theme that extends the customizer, you may want to test the resizer and offer feedback/code improvements on GitHub. Anyone interested can join the conversation in the #core-customize channel on WordPress Slack.</p>

After accumulating more than 170 plugins in five months, Gliebe decided to <a href="http://wptavern.com/pro-plugin-directory-is-seeking-a-new-owner">sell the site</a> in November citing a lack of time to devote to the project.</p>
<p>Charlie Livingston, founder of <a href="http://athemes.com/">aThemes</a>, is the new owner of <a href="https://proplugindirectory.com/pro-plugin-directory-has-a-new-owner/">Pro Plugin Directory</a>. Livingston purchased the site because he believes in its potential. Gliebe received more than 20 offers to acquire the site but after the first one fell through, he chose Livingston&#8217;s offer. The terms and financial details of the deal are undisclosed.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ProPluginDirectoryHomepage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49901"><img class="size-full wp-image-49901" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ProPluginDirectoryHomepage.png?resize=968%2C518" alt="Pro Plugin Directory Home page" /></a>Pro Plugin Directory Home page
<p>Pro Plugin Directory will remain the same in the short-term as Livingston learns how the site works. However, he plans to add new features in addition to increasing marketing efforts, &#8220;I have a few ideas about what I can do to make PPD an even better resource as the aim is to make it the go-to place for commercial plugins,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Livingston is currently soliciting feedback on what features and enhancements you&#8217;d like to see made to the directory. Pro Plugin Directory is one of the few resources devoted to listing commercial WordPress plugins so it&#8217;s great to see the directory will live on with someone willing to spend the time and effort needed to maintain the site.</p>

It is one of the most bare bones blogging themes to hit WordPress.org in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Throughout 2015, the single-column, centered layout has been a mainstay of WordPress theme designs that cater to active bloggers. Reyl Lite is a perfect example of this, with its homepage stripped down to post titles, excerpts, and minimal post meta. No featured images are required to make this design work.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/reyl-lite.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49872"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/reyl-lite.png?resize=1025%2C769" alt="reyl-lite" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49872" /></a></p>
<p>Single posts feature a large title, colorful tags and categories, with previous/next post title navigation beneath the content.</p>
<p>The theme includes customizer options that allow you to select a header image, background image/color, and header text color. If you want the design that is shown in the <a href="http://demo.quemalabs.com/reyl-lite/" target="_blank">live demo</a>, you actually don&#8217;t have to touch any of the options.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/reyl-single-post-screenshot.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49886"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/reyl-single-post-screenshot.png?resize=1025%2C712" alt="reyl-single-post-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49886" /></a></p>
<p>Reyl Lite does not include any widget areas, which creates a clutter-free display. This could be a deal breaker for those who need more customization options.</p>
<p>CSS animations are a nice touch, but one thing the theme is lacking is a default set of strong typography selections. That attention to detail would have put Reyl Lite into a more elegant category. Without this, the content falls a little flat. Fortunately, that can be easily remedied with the addition of a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=google+fonts" target="_blank">Google Fonts plugin</a> or a few modifications to a child theme.</p>
<p>One odd quirk of this theme is that the first break point is right at 1280&#215;1024 screen resolution, which is where you will see the mobile view. Other than that, it responds very well to different devices.</p>
<p>The theme was created by the folks at <a href="https://www.quemalabs.com/" target="_blank">Quema Labs</a>. The company has <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/author/nicoandrade/" target="_blank">several other free themes</a> on WordPress.org designed in a similar style. Reyl Lite&#8217;s straightforward layout and sparing use of colored links could lend charm to content-focused blogs that don&#8217;t require support for a lot of extra fluff. You can <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/reyl-lite/" target="_blank">download</a> it for free from WordPress.org.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, the WordPress community in Lahore, Pakistan held its third monthly meetup. The first meetup had just a few dozen attendees, the second approximately 300, and this weekend they had more than 500 WordPress professionals and enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Attendee <a href="https://twitter.com/noumaan_" target="_blank">Noumaan Yaqoob</a> traveled from Karachi to the event and shared his experience in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/noumaan.yaqoob/posts/10153414598007695" target="_blank">post</a> on Facebook:</p>
<p>&#8220;The auditorium was full of young students, experts, freelancers,&#8221; Yaqoob said. &#8220;There were people sitting on stairs, standing at the entrance and the organizers had to quickly install a large screen outside so that people could sit outside too. The energy of these young people was mind blowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a chance to interact with lots of participants,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They were all excited about using WordPress in their professional lives and many of them already had small freelancing setups. I was very impressed by their passion for entrepreneurship and creating jobs not just for themselves but for others too.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kashif_mp" target="_blank">Muhammad Kashif</a>, one of the organizers for the Lahore meetup, said that news of the event spread through an extensive network of Pakistani freelancers who are connected by social media. ProPakistani, a local IT news site, also published an <a href="http://propakistani.pk/2015/12/14/wordpress-meetups-is-coming-to-lahore-on-19th/" target="_blank">article</a> that helped new attendees learn about the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to close registration two days before the event because we didn&#8217;t have space,&#8221; Kashif said. He and fellow organizers, with the help of 25 volunteers, printed directions, arranged refreshments, and managed the crowd. As the meetup is still very new, they put the event together without the help of any official sponsors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got a free venue from <a href="http://techhubconnect.pitb.gov.pk/" target="_blank">TechHub Connect</a>, the local co-working space provider,&#8221; Kashif said. &#8220;The rest we managed from our own pockets. We wish we had more resources, but we will continue to do our best to educate and inspire the local WordPress community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kashif hopes that the event will attract more sponsors but wants to be careful to preserve their purpose and focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We welcome anyone who wants to join us but we would like to maintain the independence and the freedom of WordPress,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h3>Paving the Way for WordCamp Pakistan</h3>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lahore-wp-meetup-pakistan.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-49843"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lahore-wp-meetup-pakistan.jpg?resize=1025%2C547" alt="lahore-wp-meetup-pakistan" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49843" /></a></p>
<p>Organizers of the Lahore WordPress meetup expect even more attendees at the next event on January 16. They are working together with other active meetups in Karachi, Sialkot, and Hyderabad to organize WordCamp Pakistan as a mega event in September 2016. The WordPress Foundation is currently reviewing their application.</p>
<p>English and Urdu are the primary languages used by the WordPress community in Pakistan, so the WordCamp would be accessible to many more attendees from outside the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pakistan is a very multilingual country,&#8221; Kashif said. &#8220;But English is the unofficial official language. So most of the sessions are in English but the speaker or presenter may switch to Urdu to make their presentation even more interesting. We actually don&#8217;t even notice when someone has switched from English to Urdu and vice versa,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>WordPress and other open source technologies open up a world of new employment opportunities to freelancers in developing nations like Pakistan. This has helped fuel the growth of the Lahore meetup, which is now largely made up of freelancers and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The local economy is struggling, which is pushing young individuals to start their own businesses or improve their skills,&#8221; Kashif said.</p>
<p>&#8220;WordPress offers great employment opportunities as one can work from home and does not need a visa or immigration,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The ease and familiarity with English helps Pakistani freelancers work easily with clients from all over the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although some Pakistani professionals work in well-known WordPress-related businesses as remote support, customer care, or developers, a larger number are freelancers who have formed small companies and are creating new jobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pakistan has a large user base of WordPress freelancers and developers,&#8221; Kashif said. &#8220;We feel it&#8217;s about time we put it on the map and tell the world about the huge potential we have here.&#8221;</p>

The site provides a WordPress hook/API reference for developers, but creator <a href="https://twitter.com/explodybits" target="_blank">Christopher Sanford</a> has a vision to do much more with it in 2016.</p>
<p>Today Sanford announced the release of the new <a href="http://hookr.io/plugin/" target="_blank">official Hookr plugin</a>, which is available for free. It displays the actions and filters that fired as the page loaded.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hookr-plugin.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49814"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hookr-plugin.png?resize=1025%2C701" alt="hookr-plugin" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49814" /></a></p>
<p>Hovering over the indicators and clicking through to a specific hook will show its details, including the tag, invoker, description, and value.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hook-details.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49815"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hook-details.png?resize=1025%2C701" alt="hook-details" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49815" /></a></p>
<p>The plugin also includes a built-in Lucene search engine for super fast filtering from the admin bar. Developers can tweak the default Hookr settings to ignore or watch hooks with wildcards. The plugin is easily configured under the Tools menu.</p>
<p>Sanford began working on the official Hookr plugin a week before WordCamp US.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure if it would actually be useful&#8211; but I showed Zac and a few others and they seemed to like it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I pulled an 18-hour bender in Philly to get it nearly complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plugin has been beta tested for the past two weeks and is now stable and ready for use. As it&#8217;s geared purely for development, it should not be installed on a production site.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s Next for Hookr in 2016?</h3>
<p>During the past year Sanford has been steadily adding plugins at the request of users, including Pods, WP E-Commerce, Caldera Forms, and others. He hopes that commercial theme and plugin developers will get on board so that he can host their APIs as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done some substantial reworking to the parsing engine &#8211; it now tracks discrepancies between the source code and the documentation,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;This will be something that I will be offering as a service as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the short term (by the end odf Q1), I plan to keep refining the parsing engine, adding plugins, and working on features users actually care about,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be launching the API site that will be piloting around the same time. I will be working with the Rocket Genius (Gravity Forms) guys to provide realtime data for their premium plugin.&#8221;</p>
<p>After those initiatives are released, Sanford told the Tavern that he&#8217;s going to focus on creating native IDE plugins for Atom and Sublime.</p>
<h3>No Name Change Planned, Hookr Swag Store Coming Soon</h3>
<p>The Hookr name and branding has been controversial with a few who find it off-putting and offensive. Sanford considered changing the name but has now decided to keep the original brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market is flooded, it&#8217;s a short, memorable and established brand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On numerous occasions, individuals have used the term &#8216;unfortunate&#8217; to describe the name. If it&#8217;s so offensive, then why do my usage and followers keep increasing? The people complaining are not paying my bills, nor are they even relevant users of the resource. Simply put, their opinions mean nothing to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sanford has wrestled with the name change and has even purchased numerous alternative domains but nothing felt right. He will soon be launching a swag line with tees, mugs, stickers, and any product that will help him to pay for hosting Hookr.io.</p>
<p>&#8220;At WCUS, I decided that either I could limp Hookr along, or I could make it undeniably a fixture in the WordPress ecosystem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I decided on the latter. And that is exactly what I&#8217;m doing with offerings such as the Hookr plugin.&#8221;</p>

Jacoby is the project lead for bbPress and BuddyPress. In the video interview below he offers a quick overview of what to expect in BuddyPress 2.5.</p>
<p>Jacoby also gives us a look inside his <a href="https://github.com/stuttter" target="_blank">Stuttter</a> project, which contains several social components, and explores how they might fit into WordPress. These include his experiments with users, profiles, and the user experience as it pertains to aggregating activity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really just attacking the idea of the big features of BuddyPress in a smaller way that developers can interact with more conveniently, such as taxonomies and metadata vs. the big monolithic solution that BuddyPress tends to be,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don‚Äôt think my experimentation with Stuttter is going to translate into me spending less time on BuddyPress,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;It‚Äôs like a side project. It‚Äôs like an artist switching from oil to watercolor paint. You try and see what‚Äôs over there and bring back in what you learned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacoby said that he hopes to continue to provide leadership for BuddyPress for the foreseeable future. Part of this is mentoring BP core leadership to step up to feel comfortable leading and making decisions. The other part is helping the project navigate what he believes to be an identity crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;BuddyPress as a project has an identity crisis,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t know what exactly it&#8217;s supposed to be to the people who are using it. Defining what BuddyPress&#8217; identity is or what problems it&#8217;s truly trying to solve is what it needs. Until that happens it&#8217;s going to float along without a clear definition of what it&#8217;s trying to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of his efforts to help BuddyPress navigate this identity crisis, Jacoby has been talking to people and agencies who are actively using it. At the end of the interview he puts out a call for anyone who is using the software to reach out to him with feedback on where BuddyPress should go in the future.</p>

<p>When the WordPress theme review team announced it would <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options">require theme authors</a> to use the customizer to build theme options, many voiced <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options#comments">their displeasure</a> in the comments. Bruce Wampler, lead developer of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/weaver-xtreme/">Weaver Xtreme</a> WordPress theme, commented that his theme <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options#comment-67685">received a death sentence</a> due to the requirement.</p>
<p>Eight months later, Wampler has changed his tune and is now in favor of the customizer to display theme options to users, &#8220;I must admit that I was among the many objectors to this requirement. After all, my theme has over 600 options, and that is a lot of code conversion,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://weavertheme.com/wordpress-customizer-supporting-600-theme-options/">case study published on the Weaver Xtreme website</a>, Wampler describes why he&#8217;s now a fan of the customizer and explains the process of migrating 600 options to it.</p>
<h2>Live Updates</h2>
<p>One of the most compelling reasons he adopted the customizer is experiencing the live preview feature, &#8220;It is the WYSIWYG design paradigm, especially with &#8216;live update&#8217; options, of the Customizer that have become totally compelling to me. Moving the mouse over the color selector and watching it change instantly on the site preview is just something you can‚Äôt give up once you‚Äôve seen it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Serious Performance Improvements</h2>
<p>During the migration process, Wampler discovered two serious speed issues. Since the customizer processing uses JavaScript, loading hundreds of options took 30 seconds or more depending on the user&#8217;s browser and CPU.</p>
<p>The second issue involved overriding original theme setting values versus new values. The customizer used a WordPress filter for each option. Unfortunately, the filters ran every time an option was configured creating an exponentially negative impact on performance. If 40 options were processed, it resulted in 1,600 executions of the filters.</p>
<p>Wampler worked with <a href="https://weston.ruter.net/">Weston Ruter</a>, lead developer of the customizer component, who <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32103">changed the algorithm</a> to allow multidimensional settings to be scalable. Once the change was made, Wampler was able to load his theme options in one to two seconds. The fix is included in WordPress 4.4 and will help other theme authors who have more than 20 options in the customizer.</p>
<h2>My Experience Using Weaver Xtreme</h2>
<p>I installed Weaver Xtreme on a test site running WordPress 4.5 alpha to see what it&#8217;s like using the customizer when it has 600+ options. It took 6-10 seconds to initially load the customizer. Subsequent loading takes the same amount of time.</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/WeaverExtremeCustomizer.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49796"><img class="size-full wp-image-49796" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/WeaverExtremeCustomizer.png?resize=1025%2C502" alt="Weaver Xtreme's Customizer" /></a>Weaver Xtreme&#8217;s Customizer
<p>I expected to see a lot of panels expand horizontally into the theme&#8217;s design, but Weaver Xtreme only uses one panel to prevent that from happening. Limiting options to one panel helps to prevent feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Color changes happen instantaneously while other changes require the preview pane to refresh. Some of the refreshes take a few seconds to load. Overall, I found the experience to be better than configuring the theme from the WordPress backend using an options panel.</p>
<h2>The Customizer is a Great Way to Learn JavaScript Deeply</h2>
<p>The customizer is one of the newest components in WordPress. It uses object-oriented PHP and is primarily a JavaScript application. Ruter says it&#8217;s one of the best ways for theme authors to learn JavaScript deeply, &#8220;There is a lot to the customizer. It is a unique application with a lot of complexities. It uses JavaScript in some very unfamiliar ways to us who feel most comfortable in PHP, but this is good because it‚Äôs not just PHP written with JavaScript syntax; It‚Äôs a completely different language with different paradigms and ways to do things,&#8221; he told the Tavern.</p>
<p>Unlike many other areas of WordPress, there are not a lot of copy and paste solutions for the customizer. As a result of the WordPress Community Summit 2015, Ruter is making an effort to publish more articles on his <a href="https://make.xwp.co/">company&#8217;s site</a> that explain how to leverage specific features. For example, he recently <a href="https://make.xwp.co/2015/12/08/implementing-selective-refresh-in-the-customizer/">published an article</a> that explains how to implement selective refreshing.</p>
<h2>Give Weaver Xtreme a Try</h2>
<p>I encourage you to <a href="http://weavertheme.com/wordpress-customizer-supporting-600-theme-options/">read the entire case study</a> as there&#8217;s more to it than what&#8217;s written here. You should also try out <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/weaver-xtreme/">Weaver Xtreme</a> on a test site to experience what it&#8217;s like using the customizer with 600+ options. Wampler has proven that not only can the customizer scale with hundreds of options, it can do so at relatively fast speeds.</p>

<p>Today Automattic announced that the <a href="https://desktop.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress.com desktop app</a> is now open source and <a href="https://github.com/automattic/wp-desktop/" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> under the GPLv2 (or later). A Linux version joins the OS X and Windows apps that were released at the end of November and early December, making desktop publishing accessible to users on all major operating systems.</p>
<p>The apps provide a beautiful writing and editing experience that mirrors WordPress.com&#8217;s new architecture. In addition to publishing, users can browse the Reader, manage sites, customize themes, and view stats.</p>
<p>According to the GitHub repository, the desktop app is an <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" target="_blank">Electron</a> wrapper for <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso" target="_blank">Calypso</a>. Electron is what turns the new JavaScript and API-powered WordPress.com into a native app. It is a framework based on Node.js and Chromium that allows developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Electron was originally developed for GitHub&#8217;s Atom editor and then open sourced under the MIT license. Microsoft, Facebook, Slack, and Docker all have applications that use Electron.</p>
<p>The WordPress.com desktop app is split between Electron code and Calypso code, with Calypso running as a submodule. If you want to fork it to customize your own app, Automattic&#8217;s developers have written detailed instructions for <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-desktop/blob/master/docs/install.md" target="_blank">installing and running</a> the application.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-desktop/blob/master/docs/development.md" target="_blank">development guide</a> outlines the structure of the app, how it runs, where to make changes when customizing the main app, and how to debug your work. The repository also includes <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-desktop/blob/master/docs/packaging.md" target="_blank">instructions</a> for how to package your released version in a platform-specific way.</p>
<p>In the future the desktop app will become more robust as more admin screens are added to Calypso. This amazing body of work is available for anyone to use or repurpose as your own publishing app trimmed of WordPress.com&#8217;s extra features, such as stats, site management, and the Reader. For example, it would be interesting to see a bare bones fork that works with self-hosted sites without having to use Jetpack.</p>

This includes features such as semantic markup and structuring, screen reader texts and focus states on all interactive objects, high-contrast typography, and navigation suited for all input devices.</p>
<p>The theme is based on <a href="http://underscores.me/" target="_blank">Underscores</a>, a starter theme that already has accessibility baked in. Hendriksen also used Twenty Fifteen&#8217;s CSS and JavaScript to provide the menu, which works as a horizontal menu on wider screens.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/popper.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49744"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/popper.png?resize=1025%2C769" alt="popper" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49744" /></a></p>
<p>Popper comes with a handful of options available in the native customizer, including support for a site icon, a 1600 √ó 420 header image, header text and background colors, an optional left or right sidebar, and a bottom widget area. If you don&#8217;t upload a site icon (which doubles as the global home button), the theme will show the first letter of the site title.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/popper-customizer.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49759"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/popper-customizer.png?resize=1025%2C570" alt="popper-customizer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49759" /></a></p>
<p>In a <a href="http://mor10.com/introducing-popper/" target="_blank">post</a> announcing the theme, Hendriksen outlined a few of the more subtle features that you might not notice immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS flex (a.k.a. ‚Äúflexbox) used for post navigation and widgets to create a more harmonious display of content, when the widget area is set to default, the width of individual widgets changes depending on how many widgets are added to provide a more interesting display.</li>
<li>The first post on the home page is displayed as full content with the option to truncate it using the More Tag.</li>
<li>Featured Images and center-aligned images are displayed as full-bleed content on smaller screens and center automatically on wider screens.</li>
<li>Posts can have an optional deck (summary) displayed directly under the post title, powered by the custom Excerpt feature in the post editor.</li>
<li>In-content links are highlighted using a grey underline that expands on :hover and :focus.</li>
<li>If a post author has a Gravatar associated with their email address, the Gravatar appears next to the post meta.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hendriksen&#8217;s blog is currently using Popper as the <a href="http://mor10.com/" target="_blank">live demo</a> for the theme.</p>
<p>&#8220;Popper started out as a simple idea: Build a beautiful content-focused theme that met or exceeded the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/" target="_blank">WordPress Accessibililty Guidelines</a>, and provide a user experience centered around how people visit the web today: with their thumbs on mobile devices,&#8221; Hendriksen said.</p>
<p>In order to make the design thumb-friendly, he moved the mobile menu button from the top left corner to the bottom left corner. The menu appears on top of the content, instead of displacing it. &#8220;As a result, the menu is always accessible and within reach regardless of what type of device or input method you choose to use,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/popper-mobile.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49750"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/popper-mobile.png?resize=932%2C666" alt="popper-mobile" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49750" /></a></p>
<p>Hendriksen, a philosophy nerd at heart, named the theme after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper" target="_blank">Karl Popper</a>, an Austrian-British philosopher of science.</p>
<p>&#8220;Popper became the namesake for this theme due to it‚Äôs basic premise of building on what has been done before and moving the world forward by introducing evolutionary and empirically falsifiable theories about how to improve the user experience through accessibility and a focus on the hands of the mobile user,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a mobile-first theme with touch-friendly navigation that meets all of the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/" target="_blank">WordPress Accessibility Guidelines</a>, Popper is an excellent choice. It also works well as a starting place for child themes. You can <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/popper/" target="_blank">download</a> it for free on WordPress.org.</p>
<p>Popper is also <a href="https://github.com/mor10/popper" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> and Hendriksen welcomes any contributions in form of pull requests, issues, feature requests, and translations. A full feature list is available on the theme&#8217;s <a href="http://mor10.com/popper/" target="_blank">home page</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a real-world example of the WordPress REST API with code that you can dig into, the new <a href="https://ustwo.com/" target="_blank">ustwo.com</a> website is <a href="https://github.com/ustwo/ustwo.com-frontend" target="_blank">open source on GitHub</a>. ustwo is a digital product agency most well known for their work on the award-winning Monument Valley app. They partnered with <a href="https://hmn.md/" target="_blank">Human Made</a>, a WordPress development agency, to build the backend of the site.</p>
<p>The ustwo.com frontend is a React.js single-page application that serves WordPress content via the WP REST API using custom endpoints. In a post called &#8220;<a href="https://ustwo.com/blog/open-sourcing-our-website" target="_blank">Open Sourcing Our Website</a>,&#8221; ustwo developer Daniel Demmel explains why the company put the site&#8217;s frontend up on GitHub.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, we‚Äôve built something that feels novel and polished enough to share publicly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want it to be of real use to others ‚Äì after all, it‚Äôs all very well reading on a blog about how nice it is using React or Docker, with some Hello World examples, but having a chance to look under the bonnet of a production website is an entirely different thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team at ustwo decided to get innovative with a &#8220;headless WordPress&#8221; setup earlier this year, before the WP REST API was officially merged.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way we used WordPress as a headless setup accessible only through the API for a high profile production website was a bit of a technological bet ‚Äì with WP-API landing in WordPress core six months after we decided to go for it ‚Äì so sharing our experience and codebase should give execution ideas and confidence to anyone else considering this setup,&#8221; Demmel said.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Headless WordPress</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering why an agency might go to all the trouble of creating their website as a single-page application, you need only check out <a href="https://ustwo.com/" target="_blank">ustwo.com</a> to see the difference. The beautiful transitions and speediness of the UI put the site head and shoulders above similar portfolio sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;We chose to build the site as a single-page application in order to have full control over all of its aspects ‚Äì including transitions between pages ‚Äì and to make navigation super fast by not having to reload the browser,&#8221; Demmel said. &#8220;We chose React.js as a main JavaScript technology to do this, since it has built-in support to render pages on the server side too (called isomorphic rendering).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our content management system behind this is a WordPress instance which doesn‚Äôt actually render the pages itself, but instead serves content up via the API through a mixture of standard and customised JSON REST endpoints, making the vast majority of the content editable,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, <a href="http://wptavern.com/early-reviews-show-applications-like-calypso-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">WordPress.com&#8217;s Calypso project</a> runs on a similar stack. &#8220;So if you like what they‚Äôve done to make the editor experience awesome, you‚Äôll like what we‚Äôve done to make the visitor experience great,&#8221; Demmel said.</p>
<p>ustwo opted to make their work open source just like Automattic did with Calypso, recognizing the importance of sharing in helping the whole ecosystem move forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, there‚Äôs so much more value to be gained from building on each other‚Äôs work and knowledge than trying to hold on to a short-term technological advantage,&#8221; Demmel said.</p>
<h3>The REST API is Changing How Teams Work Together</h3>
<p>In a <a href="https://hmn.md/wordpress-case-study/ustwo/" target="_blank">case study</a> published on Human Made&#8217;s website, the team reviewed how working on the ustwo.com project has changed the way they work.</p>
<blockquote><p>Working with the WordPress REST API brought a separation of concerns that meant approaching project management in a new way. Our developers were focused solely on WordPress as a data entry and delivery application. We were just one part of a wider team that included a designer, a front end React developer, a front end CSS developer, a Node.js developer, a project manager, and the stakeholder. This allowed each part of the team to be completely focused on their component, working independently while feeding back to the rest of the team.</p></blockquote>
<p>Human Made attributes this tidy separation of concerns to the new workflow that naturally comes out of using a REST API. Back and frontend developers are no longer stepping on each other&#8217;s toes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The technology itself facilitated this change in project management: all that the front end developers need to make the site live is to change the URL where the data is. When developers are working locally in their development environments they can work with the content from the live site; it also streamlines the process of moving from staging to production. We found that the API hasn‚Äôt just changed WordPress but changed how people work together, creating a new workflow and pushing where WordPress is going.</p></blockquote>

<p>I <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34206">created a Trac ticket</a> asking the WordPress development team to consider adding the ability to install themes marked as favorites. Thanks to the volunteer efforts of contributors, users can install their favorite themes in WordPress 4.4.</p>
<p>To see your favorite themes, browse to the <strong>Appearance &gt; Themes</strong> section of the WordPress backend and click the Add New link. Then click on the Favorites tab. You may be prompted to login to WordPress.org as favorites are tied to the WordPress.org username.</p>

<p>Once you find the theme you want, click the Install button. Keep in mind that you can only favorite a theme from its <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/">detailed information page </a>on the WordPress theme directory and not from the backend of WordPress. Also note that like plugins, themes marked as favorites will show up on your WordPress.org user profile.</p>

<p>The first conference dedicated to the WordPress REST API is on its way to selling out. <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/" target="_blank">A Day of REST</a> will be held January 28, 2016, at Conway Hall in London. The venue has a capacity of 250 people and Petya Raykovska, one of the organizers from <a href="https://hmn.md/" target="_blank">Human Made</a>, reports that more than half the tickets have already been sold.</p>
<p>The event is aimed at developers who want to learn how to use the new API and explore applications that are already using it. <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/speakers/" target="_blank">Speakers</a> include WP REST API project leads and contributors, plus developers who are actively using the API at major companies including WIRED, Bocoup, Automattic, and the New York Times.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wp-rest-api-team.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49705"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wp-rest-api-team.png?resize=1025%2C243" alt="wp-rest-api-team" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49705" /></a></p>
<p>The full event <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/news/schedule/" target="_blank">schedule</a> has not yet been finalized but a few of the sessions have been posted with highlights of what to expect. Automattic engineer Nikolay Bachiyski will be speaking on <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/news/session-highlight-building-calypso-like-applications-with-the-wp-rest-api-nikolay-bachiyski" target="_blank">building applications like Calypso using the REST API</a>. WordPress 4.4 release lead Scott Taylor will be going in-depth on <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/news/session-highlight-scott-taylor-the-live-coverage-platform-at-the-new-york-times" target="_blank">how the REST API powers the New York Times&#8217; live coverage platform</a>. More <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/news/" target="_blank">session highlights</a> are available on the event website.</p>
<p>The event will be followed by a WordPress REST API hack day hosted by Mozilla on January 29th. Anyone interested in joining the WP API project team to contribute is welcome to attend.</p>
<p>This is an exciting time for the project with the scaffolding for the REST API recently landing in WordPress 4.4 and endpoints on their way to getting merged in 4.5. If you want to be ready to build websites and applications with the REST API in 2016, this is one of the most important WordPress conferences you can attend. <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/tickets" target="_blank">Tickets</a> are ¬£125.00 (+ VAT &amp; booking fees), which includes the presentations, lunch, breaks, swag, and an informal after-party.</p>

The community <a href="https://www.youcaring.com/terri-caissie-468821">responded in a big way</a> by completely funding the $2,500 campaign.</p>

<p>Fifty-six people contributed to the campaign, including large donations from Samuel Wood and Matt Mullenweg. In a <a href="http://wptavern.com/help-edward-caissies-wife-receive-medical-treatment-and-equipment#comment-115387">detailed comment</a> on the Tavern, Caissie expressed her gratitude to the WordPress community, &#8220;Thanks to everyone who donated and or shared the post. I know this is a bad time of year to ask for money and I‚Äôve never done anything like this before. My heart is touched very deeply and I just can‚Äôt express my gratitude enough,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She also describes some of the health issues she lives through every day, &#8220;There‚Äôs a lot more to this disease than people realize. My antibodies are eating the neurons in my brain and cerebellum (balance) so I fall a lot. This is why I‚Äôm in physio all the time. The bad neurons are sent to my muscles, which makes them cramp,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>HE/SREAT is an exceptionally rare disease with roughly 200-300 people worldwide diagnosed. So little is known about the disease that people are commonly misdiagnosed, as is the case with Caissie. In an effort to raise awareness, the <a href="http://www.hesaonline.org/">Hashimoto‚Äôs Encephalopathy SREAT Alliance</a>, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization formed in 2012, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Hashimotos-Encephalopathy-Patients-Caregivers/dp/1484883098/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1388504120&sr=1-2-catcorr&keywords=Understanding+Hashimoto%27s">published a book</a> that features stories from patients living with the disease, including Caissie&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The book contains research from doctors across the US and Canada. The goal of HESA is to have several of these books in every University and teaching hospital in North America. HE/SREAT is a difficult disease to cope with but thanks to the WordPress community&#8217;s generosity, some of the financial burden is lifted from Caissie&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p>Last week the WordPress community took to <a href="https://twitter.com/Chrisedmo/status/674347606844264451" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and the Treehouse forums to <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/community/keeping-wordpress-courses" target="_blank">express</a> <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/community/very-disappointed-in-treehouse-for-dropping-wordpress" target="_blank">disappointment</a> at <a href="http://wptavern.com/treehouse-drops-support-for-wordpress-education" target="_blank">the company&#8217;s decision to fire educator Zac Gordon</a>. According to Gordon, the company will be giving his salary to a .NET developer and will no longer create new WordPress courses, nor do they plan to update the existing courses.</p>
<p>I contacted Ryan Carson, CEO of Treehouse, to ask about the reasoning behind the decision to reallocate resources towards other technologies and whether the company would be updating its WordPress courses. Carson declined to answer any specific questions but released the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Zac has made valuable contributions to Treehouse, and we continue to wish him nothing but the best. Treehouse will continue to offer our quality WordPress content to students for the foreseeable future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company may decide to revive its WordPress education in the future with new courses and updates but for the time being it looks like they will sell the existing courses until they are outdated.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Zac Gordon is moving on to continue teaching WordPress via his site <a href="http://wpdevcasts.com/" target="_blank">WPDevCasts</a>. After attending the State of the Word address at WordCamp US, Gordon decided to seize the day by offering a <a href="http://www.javascriptforwp.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript for WordPress Master Course</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a teacher, when I heard Matt&#8217;s homework assignment, I thought, what can I do to help us all learn JavaScript?&#8221; Gordon said. &#8220;Here I was, a WordPress teacher, fresh out of work and wondering what to do next. His words really inspired me to try to do something extra special to try to give something valuable back to the community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon is working on producing the course which he said will include more than 20 individual courses and take roughy 40 hours to complete. It will cover topics such as JavaScript in Core, the REST API, major JS frameworks used with WordPress (Backbone, Angular, React), workflow tools, and walk throughs of real world examples.</p>
<p>&#8220;My hope is that this will give everyone who goes through it a solid, high level understanding of everything they need to really get rolling as WordPress JavaScript developers,&#8221; Gordon said.</p>
<p>Gordon has put together a group of community experts to oversee the curriculum development, including WP REST API project lead Rachel Baker, several JS-knowledgeable core contributors, and developers with real world experience using the new API. During the course of working with them, Gordon plans to open source the efforts of the advisors in a &#8220;JavaScript for WordPress Self Study Guide.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.javascriptforwp.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript for WordPress Master Course</a> will launch in early 2016. Gordon will also be launching a Kickstarter campaign on January 7th to help support the project.</p>

<p>Four months ago, <a href="http://wpandlegalstuff.com/" target="_blank">Richard Best</a>, a lawyer who maintains a blog focused on legal matters related to WordPress and open source, <a href="http://wpandlegalstuff.com/theme-and-plugin-shops-discouraging-public-redistribution-user-poll/" target="_blank">published a poll</a> asking for people‚Äôs views on the reselling of commercial themes and plugins. Best is working on a 10-chapter ebook called &#8220;A Practical Guide to WordPress and the GPL.&#8221; He created the poll to gain feedback on a contractual mechanism he is proposing to discourage the public redistribution of commercial themes and plugins.</p>
<p>He describes the mechanism as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>The proposed term would say that, if a customer decides to make your commercial theme or plugin available on a website for download by others, you may exercise a right to deactivate their access keys (if that‚Äôs how you‚Äôve set things up) and to terminate their access to support and updates.</p></blockquote>
<p>Best believes that this contractual mechanism is not contrary to the GPL, because it doesn‚Äôt stop them from distributing the theme or plugin. It does, however, nullify the customer&#8217;s commercial support arrangements.</p>
<p>That poll closed today and the <a href="http://wpandlegalstuff.com/theme-and-plugin-shops-discouraging-public-redistribution-user-poll/" target="_blank">results</a> are in: Of the 121 people surveyed, 76 believe the practice of redistributing a commercial plugin or theme, for free or for profit, is unethical. An additional 10 surveyed said that they don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs unethical but don‚Äôt like it.</p>
<p>Based on the results, Best concluded that there is widespread support for the inclusion of the term he outlined which would terminate a customer&#8217;s support and access to updates if they were found to be publicly redistributing the product:</p>
<blockquote><p>101 out of 121 ‚Äì supported the inclusion of such a clause, as they selected this option:</p>
<p>Yes, I would support that as I understand the business is trying to protect its investment and it poses no threat to my use of the themes or plugins.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the number of people surveyed wasn&#8217;t particularly large, more than half of them were theme and plugin business owners. In the questions specifically targeted toward them, 47 of the 67 said they like the idea of the proposed term but 26 of the 67 said they would be concerned that the WordPress community might openly criticize them for not complying with the &#8216;spirit&#8217; of the GPL.</p>
<p>Best believes that WordPress business owners should be able to employ contractual mechanisms that don&#8217;t violate the GPL in order to protect their interests.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it‚Äôs undeniable that the development of robust commercial themes and plugins supports rather than detracts from the growth of the WordPress ecosystem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just look at Automattic‚Äôs acquisition of WooCommerce as an example or the power that Gravity Forms brings to WordPress as another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Businesses that depend on and support the WordPress ecosystem should be able to protect their legitimate commercial interests without fear of verbal attack from those who cling to misconceptions of what the GPL does or doesn‚Äôt allow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Best&#8217;s <a href="http://wpandlegalstuff.com/discouraging-public-redistribution-of-commercial-themes-and-plugins-poll-results/" target="_blank">summary of the poll results</a> includes a proposed clause that terminates a customer&#8217;s support and access for engaging in public redistribution. WordPress business owners are free to use/tweak the clause as necessary, but Best includes a disclaimer that he is not providing legal advice to anyone in suggesting this kind of clause.</p>

<p>In addition to restoring the Get Shortlink button, it gives users the ability to use custom text that overrides the default URL.</p>

<p>If all you need is the button without additional functionality, the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bring-back-the-get-shortlink-button/">Bring Back The Get Shortlink Button</a> plugin by¬†<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/tfrommen/">Thorsten Frommen</a>, is a great alternative with a descriptive name. To restore the button without using a plugin, add the following code to your theme&#8217;s functions.php file.</p>
<p><code>add_filter( 'get_shortlink', function( $shortlink ) {return $shortlink;} );</code></p>
<p>Get Shortlink is a good example of WordPress hiding functionality without removing it. This allows developers to create plugins like those mentioned above to cater to users who rely on the button&#8217;s existence.</p>

<p>Politics features a homepage template with customizable sections, including a header with contact info, hero slider, featured posts, and a parallax content section. All of these sections are managed within the customizer along with options to upload a logo, set the blog layout (masonry or traditional), and customize basic theme colors. The theme also includes support for five footer widget areas.</p>
<p>Additional theme features (such as the email signup form and donations) are added via the following recommended plugins: <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/" target="_blank">Give</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailbag/" target="_blank">Mailbag</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rescue-shortcodes/" target="_blank">Rescue Shortcodes</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/" target="_blank">Jetpack</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-importer-exporter/" target="_blank">Widget Importer &amp; Exporter</a>.</p>
<p>Politics is based on Zurb&#8217;s <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a> and <a href="http://underscores.me/" target="_blank">Underscores</a>. It responds nicely to mobile devices for visitors checking out a campaign on the go.</p>

<p>You can view a <a href="http://demo.rescuethemes.com/politics/" target="_blank">live demo</a> of Politics on the Rescue Themes website with all the features enabled. A <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/politics-plus-government-campaign-wordpress-theme/12831881" target="_blank">commercial version</a> of the theme is available with additional sidebars, typography customization options, and WooCommerce support.</p>
<p>The American political season is in full swing, but Gibbs didn&#8217;t create Politics with upcoming elections in mind. She designed it as a followup to her <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/legislator-political-wordpress-campaign/7437844" target="_blank">Legislator</a> theme, which has been successful on Themeforest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure the upcoming election year crossed my mind but I think it might actually be a little late for the political theme peak for this election cycle,&#8221; Gibbs said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine most politicians would have already sorted out their websites by now. I was really just looking for a compliment to my other political theme, Legislator. I noticed that there weren&#8217;t any political themes on the WordPress theme directory so I was focusing on that underserved audience,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>So far Gibbs has had success pursuing niche themes for nonprofits, politics, breweries, and e-commerce. She is one of the few Themeforest authors trying to make a difference by adhering to WordPress best practices.</p>
<p>You can download <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/politics/" target="_blank">Politics</a> for free from WordPress.org. Demo content to populate it is available on Rescue Themes&#8217; website along with comprehensive <a href="https://rescuethemes.com/wordpress-themes/politics/" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this week Dries Buytaert, creator and project lead for Drupal, opened up a discussion on his blog about the future of Drupal architecture in a post titled <em><a href="http://buytaert.net/should-we-decouple-drupal-with-a-client-side-framework" target="_blank">Should we decouple Drupal with a client-side framework?</a></em></p>
<p>Buytaert contends that users have come to expect application-like experiences from websites, given their experiences interacting with the Facebook news feed, Gmail inbox, and Twitter&#8217;s live stream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of Drupal&#8217;s administrative interfaces and Drupal sites could benefit from a similarly seamless, instantaneous user experience,&#8221; Buytaert said. &#8220;As Drupal&#8217;s project lead, I ask myself: how can our community feel enabled and encouraged to start building rich user experiences?&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussion to decouple Drupal with a client-side framework comes at an interesting time, as Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">State of the Word address</a> heralded JavaScript as the future of WordPress and the web. His closing remarks encouraged developers to learn JavaScript and start building WordPress-powered apps for the future.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://buytaert.net/comment/120331#comment-120331" target="_blank">commenter</a> on Buytaert&#8217;s post draws a connection to Automattic&#8217;s release of Calypso:</p>
<blockquote><p>It feels like this post is at least in part a reaction to WordPress&#8217;s announcement of Calypso. Hopefully we can focus on making the decisions that are right for Drupal&#8217;s future rather than reacting hastily to what another CMS is doing, particularly when you have talked over and over how WordPress is not Drupal&#8217;s true competition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Buytaert maintains that his considerations for Drupal were independently motivated, and this isn&#8217;t the first time he&#8217;s written about <a href="http://buytaert.net/the-future-of-decoupled-drupal" target="_blank">decoupling the back and front end(s)</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for WordPress&#8217; announcement of Calypso &#8212; I actually started writing this blog post before Calypso was announced,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe my position was influenced by Calypso.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buytaert prefaced this discussion with the fact that users have come to take application-like experiences for granted as the baseline for interaction on websites. The entire web is moving in this direction and CMS&#8217;s like Drupal and WordPress are now forced to climb this mountain if they want to remain relevant. Both projects are playing from behind, trying to catch up to users expectations.</p>
<h3>The Challenge of Standardizing a Framework</h3>
<p>In many ways the discussion on Buytaert&#8217;s post is pertinent to where WordPress is headed, especially the consideration to standardize on a particular framework.</p>
<p>Buytaert advocates for a progressive decoupling for Drupal&#8217;s admin and end user experience while also enabling fully decoupled experiences to be built on top of the platform. He proposes that the best way to do this is &#8220;to formally standardize on a full-featured MV* framework (e.g. Angular, Ember, Backbone, and Knockout) or a component-based view library (e.g. React, Vue, and Riot).&#8221;</p>
<p>As he is not a front-end developer, Buytaert is soliciting input from the Drupal community on what framework would work best for progressive decoupling. He also acknowledges reasons why standardizing a particular framework might be inadvisable in the long run:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the potential benefits, there are also good reasons not to embrace a single client-side framework. New front-end frameworks are being created at what feels like an unsustainable pace; every nine months there is a new kid on the block. It&#8217;s hard for a project as large as Drupal to embrace a single technology when there is no guarantee of its longevity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, Buytaert believes that a thoughtful selection and periodic reassessment of the framework can overcome these drawbacks.</p>
<p>When encouraging WordPress developers to learn JavaScript, Matt Mullenweg did not identify a single framework but left it open. Since Automattic&#8217;s Calypso is built on React, it seems to be an early favorite.</p>
<p>If WordPress core ends up adopting the technology behind Calypso (or a Calypso-like alternative) to deliver a better publishing experience, will core standardize a framework/library or will it continue to enable and encourage extension developers to use any framework?</p>
<p>One <a href="http://buytaert.net/comment/120311#comment-120311" target="_blank">commenter</a> points out potential problems with Drupal selecting a framework, which some may perceive as an official endorsement:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are already a lot of enterprise projects using a decoupled Drupal approach and naturally they use a lot of different frameworks, but the one I see used the most is React. In fact on the project I&#8217;m working on right now, the organization is going all in with React. If Drupal settled on Angular, for example, how would it affect the organizations that are making big investments in other frameworks? Maybe I don&#8217;t understand completely how it might work, but the choice of a single framework seems like it could be divisive and disruptive &#8211; disruptive in a bad way, not the SV way.</p>
<p>I think making decoupled architectures easier is great and should be something Drupal does, but it should do so in a way that is agnostic about the FE framework used.</p></blockquote>
<p>Buytaert identifies a few alternatives to shipping a client-side framework with Drupal core, including recommending a framework but not shipping with it, or including it in core but making it easy to replace with the developer&#8217;s choice of another framework.</p>
<p>His post and the comments that follow are the beginning of a lively, thoughtful discussion that will help shape the future of Drupal development. Today Buytaert is calling for proposals that would outline a prototype for a working version of progressive decoupling.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Both WordPress and Drupal are currently engaged in the struggle to make the technological leap to provide more application-like experiences for users. The conversation surrounding <a href="http://buytaert.net/should-we-decouple-drupal-with-a-client-side-framework" target="_blank">decoupling Drupal&#8217;s architecture</a> is an important one for WordPress developers to follow and learn from.</p>

Cree suggests users check their settings to see which URL type is configured. If both the WordPress address and Site URLs don&#8217;t show https, it&#8217;s likely causing issues with responsive images in WordPress 4.4.</p>

<p>Joe McGill, who helped lead the effort to get responsive images into WordPress, also <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/responsive-images-src-url-is-https-srcset-url-is-http-no-images-loaded?utm_content=buffer1eb12&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer#post-7767555">responded in the forum thread</a> and confirms Cree&#8217;s suggestion is correct, &#8220;If you&#8217;re running HTTPS on the front end, you should change the URLS for your home and site URL in Settings &gt; General so they use the HTTPS scheme,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>McGill confirms that the issue is related <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25449">to a bug</a> in the way WordPress builds URLs. Even though the solution in the trac ticket is one line of code, McGill says it will break a lot of site configurations. If changing the settings doesn&#8217;t work or you don&#8217;t have access to the settings page, you can add this snippet of code to the functions.php file or add it as a separate plugin.</p>
<pre><code>/*
 * Force URLs in srcset attributes into HTTPS scheme.
 * This is particularly useful when you're running a Flexible SSL frontend like Cloudflare
 */
function ssl_srcset( $sources ) {
  foreach ( $sources as &amp;$source ) {
    $source['url'] = set_url_scheme( $source['url'], 'https' );
  }

  return $sources;
}
add_filter( 'wp_calculate_image_srcset', 'ssl_srcset' );
</code></pre>
<p>The solutions described above should work for most people serving content over SSL unless <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/44-https-rewritte-aint-working-with-images?replies=7#post-7768578">you&#8217;re using¬† CloudFlare</a>.

<p>Since Matt Mullenweg gave the WordPress community a homework assignment to &#8220;Learn JavaScript, deeply,&#8221; links to tutorials and training courses have been flying around. Once you have grasped some of the basics, one of the best ways to learn is to start building a small project.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to explore adding JavaScript to WordPress theming, check out <a href="https://github.com/ryelle/Anadama-React" target="_blank">Anadama</a>, an experimental <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>-based theme that uses the <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/" target="_blank">WP REST API</a> to deliver content.</p>
<p>Anadama was designed to display recipe content in a vintage recipe book style. This niche theme is well-suited to presentation as a single-page app, since it has no comments or widgets. The homepage features a menu and post titles that pop up as recipe cards.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/single-recipe.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49512"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/single-recipe.png?resize=1025%2C1279" alt="single-recipe" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49512" /></a></p>
<p>Anadama is a project still in progress, created through the collaborative efforts of developer <a href="http://t.co/vG6mrybZs8" target="_blank">Kelly Dwan</a> and designer <a href="https://twitter.com/melchoyce" target="_blank">Mel Choyce</a>, authors of popular themes <a href="http://wptavern.com/flounder-a-free-wordpress-theme-with-colorful-post-formats" target="_blank">Flounder</a> and <a href="http://wptavern.com/aventurine-a-free-wordpress-theme-featuring-bold-typography-and-bright-colors" target="_blank">Aventurine</a>.</p>
<p>The theme is small project where you can see an example of how React might fit into a WordPress theme. It requires the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/" target="_blank">REST API plugin</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-menus/" target="_blank">WP API Menus</a>. If you want to take it for a spin and experiment for yourself, clone the theme&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/ryelle/Anadama-React" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> to your test install and then run npm and gulp to install and build the JavaScript and CSS files. If you prefer a more traditional blog example, Dwan recommends checking out her <a href="https://github.com/ryelle/Foxhound" target="_blank">Foxhound</a> theme on GitHub.</p>

<p>WP Engine customers received <a href="https://wpengine.com/support/infosec/" target="_blank">an urgent notification</a> in their inboxes Wednesday evening regarding a security breach.</p>
<blockquote><p>At WP Engine we are committed to providing robust security. We are writing today to let you know that we learned of an exposure involving some of our customers‚Äô credentials. Out of an abundance of caution, we are proactively taking security measures across our entire customer base.</p></blockquote>
<p>WP Engine currently has no evidence that customer information was used inappropriately but has invalidated customer passwords as a precaution. The following five passwords associated with customer accounts will have to be reset:</p>
<ul>
<li>WP Engine User Portal</li>
<li>WordPress Database</li>
<li>SFTP</li>
<li>Original WP-Admin Account</li>
<li>Password Protected Installs and Transferable Installs</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://wpengine.com/support/infosec/" target="_blank">notice</a> states that WP Engine is taking immediate action on their end but does not include any details. The company apologized for the inconvenience of having to invalidate all customer passwords.</p>
<p>Customers took to Twitter to express <a href="https://twitter.com/ALL_CAPS/status/674803904098394112" target="_blank">frustration</a> and bemoaned the host&#8217;s lack of two-factor authentication.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/wpengine">@wpengine</a> What's with the lack of 2FA?</p>

<p></p>
<p>Representatives from WP Engine were not able to comment on the situation beyond the official notice that was posted. The company will update customers as soon as the security team learns more from their ongoing investigation. If you are a customer or have clients who host with WP Engine, you will need to reset all your passwords according to the instructions at the bottom of notice.</p>

<p>Despite <a href="http://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress">WordCamp US 2015 ending</a> less than a week ago, general admission <a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/tickets/">tickets are on sale</a> for <a href="https://2016.us.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp US 2016</a>. The event is scheduled for December 2nd-4th in Philadelphia, PA at the¬†Pennsylvania¬†Convention Center. Tickets are $40 each and grant attendees access to both days of the event, swag, and lunch.</p>
<p><a href="http://alxblock.com/">Alx Block</a>, one of the lead organizers of WordCamp US, says other ticket types will be available soon, &#8220;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> W</span>e‚Äôll absolutely offer a micro-sponsorship again, just like the Jawn this year,&#8221; he said. The 2015 event sold 2,671 tickets.</p>
<ul>
<li>1,788 General Admission</li>
<li>18 Jawn Microsponsorships</li>
<li>865 Live Stream</li>
</ul>
<p>The organizing team is hoping to double ticket sales in 2016.</p>
<p>Typically, WordCamps sell tickets a month or two from the day of the event. Block explains how WCUS is able to start selling tickets immediately, &#8220;We already have the larger logistical pieces in place. We know the location, we‚Äôve signed the contract with both the venue and the official hotel, and we‚Äôre really excited to keep the momentum going,&#8221; Block said.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re undecided as to whether WordCamp US is worth it, I encourage you to read the following recap posts by those who attended.</p>

<p>I was unable to attend this year&#8217;s event but I&#8217;ve already purchased my general admission ticket for 2016. If you have any inclination of going next year, grab your tickets now as they&#8217;re likely to sell out fast.</p>

<p>All of the <a href="http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-us-2015/" target="_blank">sessions from WordCamp US 2015</a> are slowly making their way to WordPress.tv. If you weren&#8217;t able to attend the event, the good news is that you don&#8217;t have to miss out on any of the WordPress education. The sessions are packed full of knowledge and inspiration from some of the brightest minds in WordPress.</p>

<p>Each session is <a href="http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-us-2015/" target="_blank">listed on WordPress.tv</a> with a link to its corresponding presentation slides, making it easy to follow along.</p>
<p>So far half a dozen sessions are available and the rest will be trickling onto the site during the next few days. The <a href="https://twitter.com/wordcampus" target="_blank">WordCamp US Twitter account</a> is tweeting out sessions as they arrive on WordPress.tv.</p>
<p>Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s State of the Word address is also available. While our <a href="http://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">post</a> covers the highlights, there are many more gems in his presentation.</p>

<p><a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2016/" target="_blank">WordCamp Europe 2016</a> organizers made <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2016/more-wceu-tickets-are-now-available/" target="_blank">500 more tickets</a> available this week after the first 1,000 sold out within three weeks of opening ticket sales. According to organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/petyeah" target="_blank">Petya Raykovska</a>, they are expecting 1700 attendees this year in Vienna, Austria.</p>
<p>&#8220;We opened ticket sales more than seven months before the event and it&#8217;s going a lot better than expected,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Initially we prepared for 1200 attendees but the first 1,000 tickets were sold out in less than three weeks and luckily our venue capacity is much bigger this year so we will probably be able to do 1700.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to gathering volunteers and getting sponsors for WCEU 2016, organizers are also doing a mentoring program for five different cities interested in hosting the next event. The call for applicants for 2017 will be open in two weeks.</p>
<h3>What to Expect at WCEU 2016: An Emphasis on Networking</h3>
<p>I caught up with Raykovska at WordCamp US and asked her if attendees can expect to have a European WordPress community summit attached to the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are ready to organize a community summit in Europe before or after the WordCamp, but this is not our decision,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;It has to be pre-approved by the Foundation and there is a team that has handled the summit so far. We are more than ready to host one if we are allowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;WordCamp Europe will be in June, which is less than six months from the most recent community summit, so it might not be a perfect fit in terms of time frame but we are definitely ready to jump in and help organize a community summit in Europe when we get permission,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Raykovska said that each year&#8217;s event is designed to be a unique experience for attendees, because WordCamps are so much more than simply attending sessions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are switching locations on purpose, not just to provide a chance for a new local community to host it each year but to make it more interesting for attendees, to make it a cultural experience,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year we did networking and speed networking &#8211; we put some effort into making sure people actually got to know each other and not just attend the conference to listen to talks. This year we are going to expand on that and organize some small warm-up events before the conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to help people make a connection,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to try to extend last year&#8217;s networking efforts and make sure that attendees meet as many other people as possible and not just stay in their small groups,&#8221; she said, emphasizing the importance of this aspect, as European communities are all different.</p>
<h3>A Family Friendly Event</h3>
<p>As the event is held during summer in the northern hemisphere, WordCamp Europe organizers recognize that many attendees may be traveling with their families.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to try to make the event a lot more family friendly,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;We know that as the community grows, the people grow with it. There have been so many wonderful WordPress babies in the past year and we&#8217;ve noticed all of them. We want to make sure that when people travel they can bring their families along and it can be a good family experience as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>A children&#8217;s museum is located right next door to the WordCamp venue with activities for all ages.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to establish a connection with them and working to make sure that our space provides for families and people who want to bring their kids over and spend some quality time and also go listen to sessions,&#8221; she said. Childcare is a possibility they are considering.</p>
<p>Only 228 <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2016/tickets/" target="_blank">tickets</a> remain at this time and Raykovska said they&#8217;re disappearing fast. The demand for tickets is a testament to the quality of this event and its organizers. If you&#8217;re planning to attend WordCamp Europe 2016, don&#8217;t put off buying your ticket.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a video overview of WordPress 4.4:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>WordPress 4.4 includes a variety of user facing and developer features, and¬†I consider it to be one of the most important releases for developers, and the way WordPress can be extended, in years.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go over some of¬†the most notable features in 4.4:</p>
<h3>WordPress REST API infrastructure</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15184" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/banner-1544x500-752x244.png" alt="banner-1544x500" width="752" height="244" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/">WordPress REST API</a> is going into WordPress core in multiple parts, starting with the infrastructure in 4.4. The endpoints will go in, &#8220;in a future release,&#8221; likely starting with endpoints for some core¬†object types in 4.5, but full coverage may span multiple releases.</p>
<p>The REST API has been widely covered, and was a focus area of the WordCamp US conference, but it is also a rapidly evolving part of WordPress. Decisions going into the REST API now will affect WordPress as a whole for many years.</p>
<p>There are many reasons the API is going in infrastructure first, but one important reason is that the code going into core for 4.4 is quite isolated from the endpoints that are not going in yet. The infrastructure provides a lot of helpers for plugins to extend for supporting custom endpoints, while giving the REST API and core team more time to evolve the endpoints and work out a variety of remaining challenges.</p>
<p>For people using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/">WordPress REST API feature plugin</a> (version 2 or later), you&#8217;ll still want to have the plugin installed after updating to 4.4, as the plugin will continue to provide the endpoints that are already developed.</p>
<p>The REST API infrastructure going into core is also a statement of core team endorsement, which the API needed after years of development,¬†so that developers would be comfortable basing large¬†projects on¬†it, with the understanding that it would be supported for a long time.</p>
<p>Amongst the challenges that remain for the REST API project is creating parity with the WordPress.com REST API. The WordPress.com REST API has been separately developed from the core REST API, but a number of important applications use the WordPress.com version, and both the core REST API team and key members at WordPress.com parent company Automattic believe it is in the best interest of both APIs for them to be interchangeable.</p>
<p>Both APIs have made decisions that would require some sort of bridge or support-breaking versioning in order to get on the same page. Automattic has made resources available to work with the core team over coming months to help ensure that the two play nicely together.</p>
<p>The REST API infrastructure hitting core is a huge milestone that will take WordPress to the next level. It&#8217;s more possible than ever for WordPress to be used as an application platform. It also means we will see more examples of websites using parts of WordPress and decoupling from other parts.</p>
<p>The REST API is the work of dozens, but an enormous amount of credit is due to four people that have pushed this cart up the big hill of core inclusion:¬†Ryan McCue and¬†Rachel Baker have lead the project, and Joe Hoyle and Daniel Bachhuber have been hugely influential in code and architectural decisions.</p>

<p>Congratulations to everyone involved on making this important step to WordPress&#8217;s future.</p>
<h3>Responsive Images</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15185" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/resp-images-752x312.gif" alt="resp-images" width="752" height="312" /></p>
<p>Another hugely important feature for WordPress 4.4 is the inclusion¬†of the <a href="https://responsiveimages.org/">Responsive Images Community Group&#8217;s</a> feature <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ricg-responsive-images/">plugin</a>, which is based on a specification now broadly supported in modern browsers.</p>
<p>Project lead Joe McGill outlined <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/11/10/responsive-images-in-wordpress-4-4/">how responsive images work</a>, from a technical perspective, in a recent Make Core post. Essentially, WordPress now has support for dynamically replacing images for small viewports and for retina screens. The functionality operates on an underlying WordPress function that enables responsive images on new posts and old, both in the content and within most functions themes use to display images.</p>
<p>You may wonder what images will be made available. At its core, the plugin puts all images that are the same aspect ratio as the requested image in the <code>srcset</code>. So if you insert a full size¬†image¬†and it is 1500√ó1500 and your large image size is 1024√ó1024 (the WordPress default), it would replace the full size with the large size for smaller viewports, because it is both smaller and it is the same aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If an image isn‚Äôt the same aspect ratio, it wouldn‚Äôt be used; so it prevents, for example, an intended landscape image from being replaced by a vertically cropped image on a smaller screen. Because WordPress default images skip from 300px to 1024px, a new image size has been introduced to increase the likelihood one is available for use in the <code>srcset</code>. Any custom image sizes will be available as well.</p>
<p>With this functionality, most images on every WordPress website in the world will be responsive-ready as soon as the sites are updated to WordPress 4.4. It&#8217;s a massive win for WordPress, as well as the broader web community.</p>
<h3>Term meta and taxonomy improvements</h3>
<p>WordPress 4.4 includes a long requested feature for terms with the introduction of term meta support. Term meta works much like post meta, and makes several new¬†functions available:¬†<code>add_term_meta()</code>, <code>update_term_meta()</code>, <code>delete_term_meta()</code>, and <code>get_term_meta()</code>.</p>
<p>Folks have used custom term meta for ages, but with core support, there&#8217;s now a standard way to enable developers to store arbitrary data to terms. Just like post meta, term meta can be abused, but when used smartly, it will increase the possibilities for complex websites that have complex post and term relationships. I also anticipate we&#8217;ll see helpers and user interfaces show up that make the process for registering meta fields and various form field types a simple process.</p>
<p>In addition to term meta, 4.4 also introduces <code>WP_Term</code>. Developers won&#8217;t notice a big difference now, but as project lead Boone Gorges put it <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/23/4-4-taxonomy-roundup/">in the overview post</a>, &#8220;in the future, <code>WP_Term</code> will allow for more extensive caching throughout the Taxonomy component, as well as the potential for method chaining and other developer conveniences.&#8221;</p>
<h3>oEmbed for WordPress posts</h3>
<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/new-embeds-feature-in-wordpress-4-4/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15189" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpoembed.png" alt="wpoembed" width="613" height="249" /></a></p>
<p>WordPress posts can now be embedded anywhere, with the new core <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/new-embeds-feature-in-wordpress-4-4/">WordPress supported oEmbed feature</a>. Lead by new committer Pascal Birchler as a feature as plugin, oEmbed makes sharing a WordPress post as easy as putting the URL on its own line, just as if you were sharing a Tweet or other oEmbed provider piece of content.</p>
<h3>Twenty Sixteen</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15190" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/twentysixteen-752x564.png" alt="twentysixteen" width="752" height="564" /></p>
<p>Twenty Sixteen marks the seventh Twenty-series default WordPress theme. Twenty Sixteen is another minimalist WordPress theme with a focus on blogging. Its two most visible features are the negative margin large images in the content, and the support for nearly any color background.</p>
<p>I think Twenty Sixteen is nice, but it isn&#8217;t groundbreaking theme territory. That may well change with Twenty Seventeen, which I imagine will have a larger JavaScript influence, but Twenty Sixteen is still a nice iteration on the WordPress default theme.</p>

<h3><code>WP_Comment</code> and comments overhaul</h3>
<p>Comments were a bit of a mess in WordPress. Release lead Scott Taylor took this component under his wing for 4.4, and along with Rachel Baker (the component lead), revamped a lot of comment internals.</p>
<p>Scott talked more about digging into WordPress comments in this week&#8217;s <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Post Status Draft podcast</a> (posting soon).</p>
<h3>More Multisite goodies</h3>
<p>Just as I&#8217;ve said in 4.3, and previous releases, it makes me happy to repeat that Multisite continues to see active development.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-4/">Jeremy Felt outlines</a>, WordPress 4.4 includes new support for <code>WP_Network</code> (that makes three new objects in 4.4 for those keeping count at home) as well as new network functions, actions, and filters.</p>
<h3>Another great WordPress release</h3>
<p>WordPress 4.4 is an outstanding release, and¬†Release Lead¬†Scott Taylor deserves a ton of credit for steering the ship. This release saw more overall commit activity than WordPress has seen in a single release in years.</p>
<p>In addition to a lot of code improvements, many community members made incredible efforts to consistently garden <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/">Trac</a>, where WordPress core development happens, and ensure that all tickets received at least some level of attention during the release phase of 4.4.</p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone that received props, wrote docs, advocated for, or otherwise contributed to WordPress 4.4. It&#8217;s a great way to end the year for WordPress, and sets a path for a very exciting 2016 for the WordPress project.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 09 Dec 2015 00:18:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

This release features responsive images, WordPress embeds, the Twenty Sixteen default theme, the first half of the REST API, and a host of small improvements.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Responsive Images</h2>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ResponsiveImagesFeature.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49355"><img class="size-full wp-image-49355" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ResponsiveImagesFeature.png?resize=1025%2C470" alt="Responsive Images in WordPress 4.4" /></a>Responsive Images in WordPress 4.4
<p>When users upload images to WordPress, it automatically crops them to smaller sizes. For example, if you upload an image that‚Äôs 1500 x 706, the image sizes might look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Size ‚Äì 1500 x 706</li>
<li>Large ‚Äì 500 x 235</li>
<li>Medium ‚Äì 300 x 141</li>
<li>Thumbnail ‚Äì 150 x 150</li>
</ul>
<p>WordPress 4.4 adds <code>srcset</code>¬†and <code>sizes</code> support to WordPress. This allows the software to automatically use and display the right image based on a device‚Äôs screen size. If I attach a full size 1500 x 706 image to a post in WordPress 4.4 to be viewed on a desktop, mobile devices will see the large or medium-sized image instead.</p>
<p>This decreases the amount of bandwidth used to load websites since smaller images have smaller file sizes. <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/11/10/responsive-images-in-wordpress-4-4/">Responsive images</a> don‚Äôt have any settings to configure as the magic happens behind the scenes.</p>
<h2>Embed WordPress Posts</h2>
<p>For a number of years, users have been able to embed content from <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">trusted sources</a> simply by pasting the URL into the visual editor. In 4.4, WordPress itself becomes a trusted oEmbed source which allows anyone to easily embed content from WordPress powered sites.</p>
<p>Embedded content displays in an iframe with a link to comments, a share icon, and an excerpt of the post. Here&#8217;s an example of what an oEmbedded post from a site running WordPress 4.4 looks like.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content"><p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/">Feature Plugin Merge Proposal: oEmbed</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>If you want to disable the ability for people to embed your content, install and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-embeds/">Disable Embeds</a> plugin. Disable Embeds does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevents others from embedding your site.</li>
<li>Prevents you from embedding other non-whitelisted sites.</li>
<li>Disables all JavaScript related to the feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>WordPress embeds started off as a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/new-embeds-feature-in-wordpress-4-4/">feature plugin proposal</a> by Pascal Birchler. Check out <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32522">ticket #32522</a> to see how it progressed from a proposal to a core feature.</p>
<h2>Phase One of the REST API</h2>
<p>WordPress 4.4 includes the first half of the REST API. The infrastructure portion of the API handles the routing, argument handling, JSON serialisation/deserialisation, status codes, and other items related to the API.</p>
<p>Plugin and theme authors can start using the API immediately using the infrastructure in core to replace existing custom <code>admin-ajax</code> endpoints. To learn how to authenticate with the API, see <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/rest-api-welcome-the-infrastructure-to-core/">this post</a> by Ryan Mccue.</p>
<h2>Twenty Sixteen</h2>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/">Twenty Sixteen</a> is a new default theme designed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi">Takashi Irie,</a> that was built with a mobile first, responsive approach. It has an optional right-hand sidebar and displays author information to the left of posts. It comes with four different color schemes, dark, gray, red, and yellow. Each scheme can be modified using the Customizer.</p>

<h2>Other Noteworthy Changes</h2>
<h3>WordPress Multisite</h3>
<p>WordPress Multisite has a new class called <code>WP_Network</code>. There&#8217;s also <code>*_network_option</code> functions which make it easier to use multiple networks. Jeremy Felt <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-4/">highlights new hooks added</a>, bug fixes, and deprecated functions.</p>
<h3>WP_Comments Component is Rebuilt</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/comment-object-and-query-features-in-4-4/">comments component</a> has undergone a substantial amount of work. The most noticeable difference is that the comment field displays first, followed by the Name, Email, and URL fields. This change improves navigation when using the keyboard to toggle through fields. It also makes it easier for users to leave comments.</p>
<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentsFirst.png" rel="attachment wp-att-48366"><img class="size-full wp-image-48366" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentsFirst.png?resize=1024%2C992" alt="Comment Text Area is First" /></a>Comment Text Area is First
<h3>Changes to the Headings Hierarchy on Admin Screens</h3>
<p>In an effort to improve accessibility, the headings hierarchy in the backend of WordPress 4.4 <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/31/headings-in-admin-screens-change-in-wordpress-4-3/">restores the H1 heading level</a> to admin screens. This helps screen readers discern and locate important information on a page.</p>
<p>Plugin and theme authors are highly encouraged to restructure their document headings hierarchy to ensure that heading levels are not skipped. Andrea Fercia <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/headings-hierarchy-changes-in-the-admin-screens/">explains why it matters</a> and how to ensure you have the proper headings.</p>
<h3>Taxonomy Term Meta</h3>
<p>In the last few releases cycles, the team has been working hard to complete tasks from the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/27/taxonomy-roadmap-for-4-4-and-beyond/">Taxonomy roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>In WordPress 4.3, the development team successfully split shared taxonomy terms, which ensures that terms can be uniquely identified by their <code>term_id</code>. In 4.4, the <code>$taxonomy</code> parameter is now optional in <code>get_term()</code> and <code>get_term_field()</code>, functions that previously required both <code>$term_id</code> and <code>$taxonomy</code>.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.4 also introduces <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10142">Term Meta</a> where developers can use the new term meta API to store arbitrary data about taxonomy terms, in the same way you would for posts, users, or comments.</p>
<p>Boone Gorges, one of the lead developers working on the roadmap, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/23/4-4-taxonomy-roundup/">explains the improvements</a> in detail related to Taxonomy data in WordPress 4.4.</p>
<h3>WP_Title is Not Deprecated</h3>
<p>Contrary to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-4-to-deprecate-the-wp_title-function">earlier reports</a>, the core development team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/11/11/wordpress-4-4-field-guide/">decided</a> not to deprecate the WP_Title function. It&#8217;s considered a zombie function and <code>add_theme_support( </code><code>'title-tag'</code> ); remains the recommended way to insert the title tag in themes.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>my-hacks.php is not deprecated and will remain in WordPress</li>
<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/07/single-post_type-post_name-php-new-theme-template-in-wordpress-4-4/">New theme template</a> in WordPress 4.4: single-{post_type}-{post_name}.php</li>
<li>Unattached attachments <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/34690">have pretty permalinks</a></li>
<li>The <code>show_ui</code> argument for post types <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/15/enforcing-the-show_ui-argument-for-post-types/">is now enforced</a> to correct unexpected behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>WordPress 4.4 has more than 2,000 commits from over 400 contributors. In the <a href="https://videopress.com/v/0taparK5">State of The Word 2015</a>, Taylor says that one of the goals in this release was to go through the extensive backlog of tickets and review patches that were forgotten. Thanks to the efforts of volunteer <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/bug-gardening/">bug gardeners</a> on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/">Trac</a>, he <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticketgraph">accomplished that goal</a>.</p>
<p>If you experience any issues with WordPress 4.4, please <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/">report them on the support forums</a>. Volunteers are watching support threads closely and, if warranted, will create a thread listing known issues. After <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/12/clifford/">updating your sites</a>, come back and let us know what you think of the new features.</p>

<p><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> will be discontinuing its WordPress education courses. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/wpdevcasts" target="_blank">Zac Gordon</a>, one of the site&#8217;s former educators, no new WordPress, BuddyPress, or WooCommerce courses will be created and existing content will not be updated in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;The online learning company where I have been teaching WordPress for the last 3+ years told me that they were going to stop teaching WordPress, give my salary to a .NET teacher, and fire me,&#8221; Gordon said.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://wp.zacgordon.com/2015/12/08/the-sustaining-heart-of-the-wordpress-community/" target="_blank">post</a> announcing his departure, Gordon said that during his employment at Treehouse he was unable to convince the company of the value of investing in WordPress.</p>
<p>&#8220;While working at Treehouse I attended between 8-12 WordCamps per year and spoke about a range of the subjects I taught at Treehouse,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not everyone knows this, but Treehouse didn‚Äôt pay for 95% of these trips. In fact, I regularly fought with Treehouse to see the value of sponsoring WordCamps, sending me to them to speak, and even that giving back to the community is an important thing we should do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gordon&#8217;s understanding is that Treehouse will now be focusing its resources on technologies like Java, .NET, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Despite the struggle to find a new way to support himself, Gordon is determined to continue <a href="http://wpdevcasts.com/" target="_blank">teaching WordPress</a>. Check out WP Tavern&#8217;s exclusive interview with him at WordCamp US where he elaborates on Treehouse&#8217;s decision.</p>

The survey is not tied to any affiliate programs and serves as one of the few impartial resources where you can expect honest reviews from customers. The survey collects the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Average satisfaction</li>
<li>Value</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Median site count</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>WordPress compatibility</li>
</ol>
<p>The survey is open until the end of the year and results will be published in January 2016.
