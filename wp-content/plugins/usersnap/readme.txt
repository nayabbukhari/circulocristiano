With point and click issue reporting, tracking bugs was never easier. Screenshots, the used browser version and a lot of additional information help you to solve every web issue faster. No endless bug reporting forms for your users. A small snippet of code on the website creates a feedback button. Your users may highlight, blackout and use sticky notes to give visual feedback which is then sent to you!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

The Usersnap snippet is loaded asynchronously (like Google Analytics) - It does not impact page loading and rendering times. Additionally, we are using a strong CDN to ensure the best user experience.

We are supporting all major browsers, both desktop and mobile.

= Does Usersnap work in local development environments? =
In order to use Usersnap with a local development machine (or any other on premise machine), we recommend a forwarding service like PageKite. Another option is to use <a href="https://usersnap.com/docs/dashboard/browser-extensions" target="_blank">our browser extensions</a> they work in a local environment, too.

sersnap supports screen resolutions up to 4K high definition, which results in 3840x2160 pixels for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.

If the screen size exceeds the corresponding maximum screen resolution, your image will be cropped. If you need larger screens for your web project, please contact us, we are happy to find a custom solution for you.
