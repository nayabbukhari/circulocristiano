== Installation ==
= Main Plugin =
1. Upload the `store-locator` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Sign up for a Google Maps API Key for your domain (not required in Maps V3, unless needed for high usage sites). Instructions: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key
4. Add your locations through the 'Locations' page in the Store Locator admin area
5. Place the shortcode `[STORE-LOCATOR]` in the body of a Page or a Post to display your store locator

= Addons =
1. Unzip & Upload the entire addon folder to the `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/addons` directory
2. Activate the addon by submitting the activation key (which you receive after purchasing it) to the "Activation Keys" section of your pull-out admin dashboard (If you have the Addons Platform installed, you submit activation keys on the 'Addons' > 'Settings' page)

= Themes =
1. Unzip & Upload the entire theme folder to the `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/themes` directory
2. Select theme from the theme dropdown menu under the "Design" section on the "MapDesigner" Page

= Icons =
1. There are some default icons in the `/wp-content/plugins/store-locator/icons` directory
2. Add your own custom icons in to `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-icons`

= Custom Images =
1. You can create your own custom 'search_button.{...}png' images and place them under `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/images/`
2. The store locator will give priority to the 'search_button.{...}png' images in the `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/images/` folder over the default 'search_button.{...}png' images in the main `store-locator/` folder, allowing for store locator plugin updates without worrying about losing your custom button images

= Custom CSS (Stylesheet) =
1. You can modify the default 'store-locator.css' and place it under `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-css/`
2. The store locator will give priority to the 'store-locator.css' in the `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-css/` folder over the default 'store-locator.css' in the main `store-locator/` folder. This allows you to update the main store locator plugin without worrying about losing your custom styling.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Make sure to check http://docs.viadat.com for the most updated information

= My Store Locator seems to all of a sudden not display locations / My addon isn't validating -- just a spinning image in the pull-out Dashboard =
* Are you 'hardening' / blocking your 'wp-content' directory with a security plugin, php.ini, robots.txt or .htaccess (sometimes wp-content/.htaccess)?  Blocking wp-content functionality completely will disrupt proper Store Locator & addon operation.
* For Store Locator not displaying locations:  when on your Store Locator page, turn on Firefox Firebug or Google Chrome Developer Tools, and view Console > All.  Oftentimes you may see 'Multiple instances of Google API' error, which is caused by another plugin or your theme including it a 2nd time, or you will see a number of other JavaScript errors that your website is outputing (usually from other plugins) that can affect the map's display -- resolving these usually fixes most problems. 

= Can I display {certain information} in search results? =
* Yes, the [Advanced Theme Manager addon](http://docs.viadat.com/Advanced_Theme_Manager), which comes with a complimentary theme, called 'SL Starter'. Copy 'sl-starter' folder from your 'advanced-theme-manager' folder into 'wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/themes/', select SL Starter under 'Design' section in MapDesigner, and modify its templates under Store Locator > Addons > Settings > Advanced Theme Manager as needed

= I'm getting 'failed to geocode' error messages -- why? =
* Have you updated your Store Locator? [It's mandatory to be using Store Locator v2.x](http://www.viadat.com/2013/10/important-update-store-locator-v2-uses-google-maps-api-v3) if you want anything to work
* Since Store Locator v3.0, the [Super Geocoder](http://docs.viadat.com/Super_Geocder) addon geocodes locations not geocoding due to reaching Google geocoding quota limits (based on your website's IP address)

= Bought the CSV Importer ... =
* Nearly all your questions [have been answered here](http://docs.viadat.com/CSV_Importer_Geocoder_Exporter_XML_Exporter). If you follow these instructions & answers exactly, you should be fine

= I'm using an updated Store Locator, but still no luck geocoding when adding a location =
* [Google's Geocoding API v3 has 2,500 geocode per day limit](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/index#Limits), so you may need to wait several hours, and try to add your locations again

= Is this plugin USA-only? / Does it support locations in multiple countries? =
This plugin in not USA-only, and yes, it supports locations all over the world -- as long as the Google Maps API properly supports it:

* On the MapDesigner admin page (v2.x+), you can select your main country. This gives the Google Maps API a region to focus on
* [For non-USA addresses, use the 'State' field for the Country / Region](http://docs.viadat.com/Main_Page#How_do_I_enter_non-US_addresses.3F) containing the city & location you are submitting (regions, such as country, province, territory, arrondissement, protectorate, S.A.R, state, etc.). When you use any of these types of regions, the Google Maps API will still geocode (give coordinates) to them
* [It has been translated](http://docs.viadat.com/Main_Page#Special_Thanks_to_Translators) into 15+ languages -- if you would like to [provide a new or updated translation](http://www.viadat.com/2009/02/store-locator-translation-files-wanted-you-might-just-get-something-nice-in-return/), please do so

= Can I display the Store Locator in a page template instead of using shortcode in a Page or a Post? =
* Yes, in your page template, instead of `do_shortcode("[STORE-LOCATOR]")` add the code:`if (function_exists("sl_template")) {print sl_template("[STORE-LOCATOR]");}`
* Additionally, for versions prior to Store Locator v3.0, you would also need to add the following to your theme's functions.php file:`if (!function_exists("show_sl_scripts")){	function show_sl_scripts(){}}`

= I'm seeing a 'Google Maps is disabled', or other Google Maps error messages on my website when viewing my Store Locator =
* Are you using Store Locator v1.9.7 or earlier?  You must update immediately

= If I need to rename my folder from the older 'wordpress-store-locator-location-finder' to 'store-locator', will I lose my locations? =
* No. You won't lose them. And make sure to re-select your home & end map markers in MapDesigner after renaming

= How can I have more than one Store Locator map on my website? =
* Yes, the [Multiple Mapper addon](http://docs.viadat.com/Multiple_Mapper)

= I would like to show different icons for different locations -- can that be done? =
* Yes, the [Categorizer addon](http://docs.viadat.com/Categorizer)

= Do I need a Google Account to use this store locator? =
Since Store Locator v2.x, which uses Google Maps API v3, it is not required like it was in Google Maps API v2. However, high-usage sites may still need an API key to monitor usage. Thus, if needed:

1. To sign up for a Google Account, visit: https://www.google.com/accounts/
2. To sign up for a Google Maps API Key, visit: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key

= How Do I use a Translation? =
1. Place .po & .mo translation files into the `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/languages` folder, and then change the `WPLANG` constant to the corresponding language abbreviation in the `wp-config.php` file in the root wordpress directory
2. Example - using French (pre-WP 4.0): make sure `lol-fr_FR.po` & `lol-fr_FR.mo` are in the `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/languages` folder, then make sure to update the code in `wp-config.php` to read `define('WPLANG', 'fr_FR')`, and Voila, Il sera en francais (It will be in French).
3. Example - using French (WP 4.0+):  go to General > Settings > "Site Language" option to choose French language (may need to first install language pack)
